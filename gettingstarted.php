<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>BEFORE YOU GET STARTED:</big></big><br>
<br>
There are a few things to keep in mind while using ELDER:<br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is not a finished software
yet.</span>&nbsp; You shouldn't encounter errors, but if you do, please
    <a href="mailto:anna.belew@gmail.com">email us</a> a copy of
whatever error text you got, along with a brief description of what you
were trying to do when the error occurred.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">CONSISTENCY</span> is very
important!&nbsp; ELDER's cross-referencing ability depends partially on the
characters that represent a word's IPA transcription. It can't possibly
know that m&#665;&#649; and m&#665;&#623; were intended to be the same word.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Before you enter a word, search for its
gloss</span> to avoid entering a new word with a slightly different
transcription.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Just like when entering words, make sure that anything you enter
as sentence components are <span style="font-weight: bold;">transcribed
uniformly</span>.&nbsp; Don't enter one sentence as /m&#601; j&#601;n l&#601;m gi/ and
the next as /m&#601; j&#601;n l&#616;m ki/.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
